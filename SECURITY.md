# Security Policy for PyATS VLAN Verification Script

## Purpose
This security policy outlines the measures and best practices to ensure the safe and secure execution of the PyATS script for verifying VLAN configurations on Cisco network devices. Adhering to this policy will help prevent unauthorized access, protect sensitive information, and maintain the integrity and availability of network devices.

## Scope
This policy applies to all users who have access to the PyATS script and the associated network devices defined in the testbed file.

## Security Measures

### 1. Access Control
- **User Authentication**: Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to the script and the network devices.
- **Testbed Credentials**: Store testbed credentials securely. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information (e.g., usernames, passwords) directly in the script. Use environment variables or encrypted files to manage credentials.
- **Least Privilege**: Assign the minimum necessary privileges to the user accounts used in the testbed configuration to limit potential damage in case of credential compromise.

### 2. Data Protection
- **Encryption**: Use secure communication protocols (e.g., SSH) to connect to network devices, ensuring that data transmitted over the network is encrypted.
- **Sensitive Information**: Avoid logging sensitive information such as passwords or device configurations in plaintext. Use secure logging practices.

### 3. Environment Security
- **Virtual Environment**: Run the script within a virtual environment to isolate dependencies and minimize the risk of conflicts with other installed packages.
- **Secure Storage**: Store the testbed file and the script in a secure location with appropriate access controls to prevent unauthorized access and modifications.

### 4. Network Security
- **Firewall Rules**: Ensure that the network devices are protected by appropriate firewall rules to restrict access to trusted IP addresses only.
- **VLAN Configuration**: Validate the VLAN IDs before running the script to prevent accidental misconfigurations or incorrect assumptions.

### 5. Code Security
- **Code Review**: Perform regular code reviews to identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Update Libraries**: Keep the PyATS and Genie libraries up to date to ensure that security patches and improvements are applied.

### 6. Incident Response
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring to track script executions and detect any unauthorized or suspicious activities.
- **Incident Handling**: Establish procedures for responding to security incidents, including the identification, containment, eradication, and recovery phases.

## Compliance
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits to ensure compliance with this policy and identify areas for improvement.
- **Training**: Provide training and awareness programs for users to understand and adhere to this security policy.
